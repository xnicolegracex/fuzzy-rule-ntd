## Fuzzy Rule Based Expert System for Early Diagnosis of Skin Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTD)

## Introduction 
Skin is the largest organ, also the first and most noticeable part of the body. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), skin diseases are the third most prevalent cause of illness and one of the top 10 causes of disability. They are also among the 10 most common causes of outpatient visits. Any changes in the skin, such as colour, texture, and appearance, can indicate the presence of various diseases, including Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs). 

NTDs are a group of infectious diseases that disproportionately affect marginalised and poverty-stricken populations in tropical and subtropical regions. A significant proportion of NTDs also manifest on the skin, with 9 of them classified as skin NTDs. They are characterised by skin lesions and include diseases such as Buruli Ulcer, Cutaneous Leishmaniasis, Post-kala-azar Dermal Leishmaniasis, Leprosy, Lymphatic Filariasis, Mycetoma, Onchocerciasis, Scabies and Yaws. These Skin NTDs all have significant skin changes at some point in their progression, it may be the first symptoms patients notice, even before changes in internal organs or other systems occur. 

Currently, there are a few common methods to diagnose NTDs which are clinical examination, laboratory testing, imaging tests, biopsy, rapid diagnostic tests and also a mobile application with diagnostic tools. However each of these methods has their own respective limitations which will be discussed further in the Literature Review section. Thus, there is a need for alternative methods that are able to improve the diagnostic accuracy and efficiency of skin NTDs. 

A fuzzy rule-based expert system is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) system that uses a set of "fuzzy" rules to make complex decisions or offer recommendations. These rules are based on expert knowledge, and they use imprecise or ambiguous language to account for uncertainty and subjectivity in the data. In the context of diagnosing Skin NTDs (Neglected Tropical Diseases), a fuzzy rule-based expert system can be used to analyse patient information and symptoms, such as the lump size, itchiness, location and other relevant factors. The obtained information will then be used to suggest a provisional and early diagnosis or treatment plan. 

With the collaboration of 2 dermatologists and also referring to the guide book published by World Health Organization (https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789241513531), this study aims to fill this gap by proposing a new diagnostic tool based on a multiple input single output Mamdani controller. The proposed system takes into account multiple skin signs and symptoms, including patches on the skin, itchiness, and others, to provide a more comprehensive and accurate diagnosis. The use of a fuzzy rule-based expert system allows for a more human-like decision-making process and accommodates for uncertainty and ambiguity in the diagnostic process. 

The system uses fuzzification to process the input data and then applies a set of fuzzy rules to make a diagnosis. The defuzzification method used is the Centroid Method which provides a clear and crisp output. The proposed system has the potential to make a significant contribution to the field by improving the early diagnosis and management of skin NTDs in poor and marginalised communities. The implementation of this system could lead to the development of similar diagnostic tools for other NTDs, further enhancing the impact on global health.
