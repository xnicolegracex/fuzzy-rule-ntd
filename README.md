## Fuzzy Rule Based Expert System for Early Diagnosis of Skin Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTD)

The diagnosis of skin Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) is a challenge, especially in poor and marginalised communities. Currently, the available diagnostic tools, including a mobile application, suffer from limitations such as taking into account only one skin sign at a time and not providing a definitive diagnosis. This study aims to fill this gap by proposing a new diagnostic tool based on a multiple input single output Mamdani controller. 

The proposed system takes into account multiple skin signs and symptoms, including patches on the skin, itchiness, and others, to provide a more comprehensive and accurate diagnosis. The use of a fuzzy rule-based expert system allows for a more human-like decision-making process and accommodates for uncertainty and ambiguity in the diagnostic process. 

The system uses fuzzification to process the input data and then applies a set of fuzzy rules to make a diagnosis. The defuzzification method used is the Centroid Method which provides a clear and crisp output. The proposed system has the potential to make a significant contribution to the field by improving the early diagnosis and management of skin NTDs in poor and marginalised communities. The implementation of this system could lead to the development of similar diagnostic tools for other NTDs, further enhancing the impact on global health.
