document.getElementById("description").innerText = "An infection mainly affecting the skin caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans. The mode of transmission is not known, although in many cases there is associated exposure to rivers, streams or wetlands. The first changes are often raised lumps on the skin that subsequently ulcerate. These ulcers are usually single and large, with a yellowish surface appearance and an underlying red moist base; sometimes 2–3 ulcers may appear. The edges of the ulcer are often undermined, making it easy to insert a blunt probe for a short distance underneath it. During the early stages of infection, extensive swelling may extend around the emerging ulcerated area; this is characteristic of Buruli ulcers. Most patients living in areas where the disease is endemic are children aged under 15 years.

Reservoir hosts are wild animals, domestic animals and humans. It also presents with lumps on the skin that can be rounded or flat and which may ulcerate in the centre – the base of the ulcer is usually red and bleeds easily. Ulcer edges or borders are often raised. Lesions may be single or multiple, usually occurring on exposed sites such as the face or limbs and containing variable numbers of Leishmania parasites. It may affect any age group; while infection normally occurs sporadically, large numbers of people may be affected in areas where displaced populations are housed. The visible changes may vary in different parts of the endemic range; for instance, in areas of South America lesions may also occur in the mouth or nasal passages.

document.getElementById("description").innerText = "Leprosy is a systemic infection caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium leprae, which targets the skin and nerves. Although much of the damage caused by leprosy results from destruction of nerves, the skin is affected early in the course of the infection. This disease is transmitted directly through close contact over long periods. Leprosy is transmitted via droplets, from the nose and mouth, during close and frequent contacts with untreated cases. Infection can occur at any age. The first signs are usually skin patches of variable sizes that are usually dry and whose colour may be slightly paler than the rest of the skin. Another presentation of leprosy takes the form of multiple lumps, also in variable sizes. Leprosy destroys nerves, and it is easy to damage the skin because patients cannot feel hot objects or rubbing shoes, and ulcers form at these sites. If untreated, these ulcers (usually on the hands or on the feet), which are known as neuropathic ulcers, can proceed to destroy other structures in the area including bone.

Although it is not completely clear whether these skin lesions are caused by the presence of viable organisms, they do contain a variable number of Leishmania parasites and are treated with anti-Leishmania medications. These lesions are usually either pale patches, or small or large lumps. This form of leishmaniasis may occur at any age but develops in around 10–30% of patients some 6–12 months after apparent resolution of visceral (internal) leishmaniasis.

document.getElementById("description").innerText = "Mycetoma is an infection of the subcutaneous tissue and bone caused by a variety of different environmental bacteria and fungi. The disease follows implantation of fungi or filamentous bacteria from plant debris or soil through a deep skin injury such as a thorn prick. In mycetoma, there is an infection under the skin that causes the development of a large lump which is usually painless. As this enlarges it becomes covered in smaller lumps, some of which are filled with pus; these discharge yellow or blood-stained fluid that may contain the microcolonies of the infecting organisms seen as tiny black or pale pieces of grit. In advanced mycetoma, the bone in the area is invaded with local destruction and the part of the limb or body affected becomes swollen and deformed. Adults are mainly affected, although rare childhood cases occur. Other deep mycoses seen affecting the skin include chromoblastomycosis where there are thick raised patches often with a rough surface like very large warts.

document.getElementById("diagnosis_result") = "Onchocerciasis"
document.getElementById("description").innerText = "It is a systemic filarial infection that affects the skin and the eye. Infection may lead to blindness or debilitating skin disease. The filarial worm is transmitted by black flies that breed near fast running streams and rivers.  People are most likely to complain of troublesome itch. Symptomatic skin signs are produced by the inflammatory response to dying microfilaria (an early larval form of the parasite). Similarly, inflammation near the pupil of the eye, corneal scarring and retinal damage result from the inflammatory response to microfilariae. Many patients with onchocerciasis do not have marked skin symptoms, although as the disease progresses the skin becomes wrinkly and skin folds can enlarge and sag, for example in the groin (hanging groin), and visible depigmentation may occur (leopard skin). However, in many endemic areas, it is accompanied by small itchy lumps on the skin, often around the shoulders or waist and thighs; constant scratching is common. Sometimes, small itchy lumps appear more densely on one limb than the other and the skin of the affected limb becomes rough, chronically itchy and with thickened patches that are darker in colour than the rest of the skin; these patches are intensely itchy. Onchocerciasis can occur at all ages, although most cases are recognized in older children or adults.

The skin in certain areas is covered with small lumps, some containing pus as well as small squiggly lines where the mites burrow into the skin. Hands, feet, external genitalia, buttocks and shoulders are all commonly affected and usually other members of the household are infected and itch. Secondary bacterial (streptococcal) infection of scabies may cause kidney inflammation or nephritis, an immunological reaction to the bacteria, in children."

document.getElementById("description").innerText = "It is transmitted by mosquitoes where the filarial worms live in, dilate and obstruct the lymphatic channels, usually in the lower parts of the body such as the groin and genital area and thighs. Adult worms produce immature microfilariae that can be detected in blood at times specific to the periodicity of the parasite. Infections impair lymph flow, leading to progressive swelling of the lower limbs and, in males, swelling of the scrotum. Other parts of the body can be involved such as the breasts or vulva in females. Although lymphatic filariasis often starts in childhood, it becomes prominent in adults where the results of progressive lymphatic obstruction are apparent. A clinical diagnosis is suggested if one leg becomes swollen and/or if the leg on one side is more swollen than the other. Acute attacks progress the severity of disease. The affected area is warm, reddish and painful. With time the skin may become thickened, covered in small lumps giving a cobbled appearance and susceptible to recurrent infections."
